## Motion histogram warning (from compiler)

All 11 beats use `fade` transition (100%). The compiler warns >40% pantry cap. This is expected: the `fade` refers to the *beat transition* declared in the beat sheet, not the internal motion of each scene — each Remotion component has its own spring-animated motion (stems, nodes, cards, orbits, etc.). Not a visual defect.
