## Warnings from compile.py (acknowledged)

- B08 empty spark line: ClaudeComposerAsk does not render a spark line — lint false-positive on this beat type. No fix needed.
- 100% Remotion ratio: by design, this is a pure Remotion reel. No pantry beats were appropriate.

## Verdict

**PASS** — ready for final cut.
