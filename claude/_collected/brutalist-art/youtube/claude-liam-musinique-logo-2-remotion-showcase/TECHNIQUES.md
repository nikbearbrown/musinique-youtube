## Notes

- **B03 Draw-On Stroke:** uses `@remotion/paths` `evolvePath()` on the full 99k-char path. Works correctly but is compute-intensive per frame; the render was CPU-heavy on this beat.
- **B09 Color Interpolation:** this is the one treatment beat where the logo escapes its ink color — verified `interpolateColors` is available in the installed Remotion build (`function` type confirmed at runtime). Root.tsx imports were previously commented out with incorrect notes about unavailability; both have been restored.
- **B10 Kinetic Grid:** uses 3×4 = 12 tiles rather than 4×5 = 20 to keep tiles readable in portrait with the square 2048×2048 viewBox.
- **B18 Stroke Pulse / B19 Scale Breathe:** these two techniques are unique to this reel (not in the H-mark or HAI wordmark showcase); they exploit the single-path nature of the Musinique mark.
- **Path data:** extracted to `runtime/remotion/src/musinique-logo-2-path.ts` as a TS module (avoids JSON import path issues with Remotion's webpack bundler).
