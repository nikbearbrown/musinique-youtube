## Defect log

| ID   | Beat | Severity | Description | Action |
|------|------|----------|-------------|--------|
| D001 | B03  | MINOR-COSMETIC | Empty sparkLine prop renders as underline dash | Log only; matches exemplar behavior; not BLOCKER/MAJOR |
| D002 | BHTF | MINOR-COSMETIC | Same empty sparkLine artifact | Log only; same root cause |

## Summary

**Zero BLOCKER / Zero MAJOR defects.** Two MINOR-COSMETIC defects (empty sparkLine artifact in

Not re-rendered per contract (re-render until zero BLOCKER/MAJOR).
