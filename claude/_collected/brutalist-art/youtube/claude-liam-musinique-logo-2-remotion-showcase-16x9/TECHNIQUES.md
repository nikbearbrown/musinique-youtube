## Notes

- All 20 technique beats rendered clean — no slate fallbacks needed.
- B08 (Opacity Through Blur): at frame 2400 the mark is mid-reveal; the blur-sharpening effect is clearly visible.
- B09 (Color Interpolation): treatment beat — ink sweeps to terracotta, then to teal. Explicit palette violation, intentional.
- B10 (Kinetic Grid): 4×2 tile, staggered ripple wave uses sin() phase offset per column+row distance.
- B17 (Composer Summon): custom in-scene composer card (no ClaudeComposerAsk component) — mark assembles below as the "result".
- B03 (Draw-On Stroke): estimated strokeDasharray at 120000 — this is a conservative estimate for the 73-subpath logo; actual path length is longer. The reveal still reads as a draw-on because progress × STROKE_LEN always covers the visible portion of the stroke from the beginning.
- Root.tsx: two pre-existing portrait showcase files (MusiniquLogoRemotionShowcase.tsx — missing — and MusiniqueLogo2RemotionShowcase.tsx — uses `interpolateColors` not in this remotion build) are temporarily commented out in Root.tsx to unblock the bundle. They were already failing before this reel was built.
