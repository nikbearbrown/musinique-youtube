## Notes

- **B03 Draw-On Stroke** uses `@remotion/paths` `evolvePath()` on the full complex path (7500×5000 viewBox, single d-string). Stroke traces in terracotta, fill floods behind.
- **B09 Color Interpolation** is the one designated color treatment beat. Mark cycles black→terracotta→black.
- **B17 Composer Summon** shows the Claude composer card with a realistic prompt being typed, terracotta spark on send, mark materializes below.
- **B18 Stroke Pulse** uses `strokeDasharray` / `strokeDashoffset` cycling to create a heartbeat rhythm across the path in terracotta.
- **B20 Exit Family** runs three exit moves back-to-back in thirds: Shrink Spin → Blur Out → Mask Close.
- All SVG filters from the source file are dropped (per spec). The `<rect class="st0">` background rect is also dropped — cream PAGE is the stage.
- Logo ink: `#000000` on cream `#FAF9F5` except B09 (color treatment) and B17 (composer context).
- One terracotta `#D97757` accent moment per technique beat. No beat has two orange things.
