## Violations

| beat | law violated | fix |
|------|-------------|-----|
| YTV01 (pos 0) | ORDER LAW — YTV01 before B00 | Move YTV01 to after B06 |
| B00 | IN-FOR-BEAR LAW — narration lacks "in for Bear" phrase | VISUAL-ONLY: cannot regen ElevenLabs audio; flag for human follow-up |
| B07 | HANDOFF LAW — B07 is ClaudeWindow VERDICT, not a prompt-read handoff | VISUAL-ONLY: cannot add handoff without new audio; flag for human follow-up |

## ElevenLabs flag
This reel uses ElevenLabs audio. Per House Laws and batch constraints:
- Audio regeneration is BLOCKED (paid, not approved for this batch)
- Visual-only fixes only: reorder beats in beat_sheet.json
- IN-FOR-BEAR and HANDOFF violations CANNOT be fully remediated without ElevenLabs
- Flag in BUILD-LOG as "PARTIAL — ElevenLabs gated: IN-FOR-BEAR and HANDOFF need human pass"

## Actions required
1. Edit beat_sheet.json: move YTV01 to after B06
2. Render beats via custom remotion-src/ Taught.tsx component (if renders don't exist)
3. Compile master via compile.py
4. LOG: ElevenLabs gated violations flagged; human must schedule ElevenLabs pass
