# BUILD-REPORT.md — NBB-wrap: vox-spindle-checkpoint

**Date:** 2026-07-16 (rebuilt from review cut)
**Protocol:** NBB-wrap (unattended build)
**Rebuild reason:** Previous build (2026-07-16T12:27:25) used the slate as the body source. This rebuild uses the review cut, which contains the corrected B04 layout (chromosome alignment graphic). The old `beat_sheet.nbb.json` is preserved as `beat_sheet.nbb.old.json`.

| Artifact | Notes |
|---|---|
| `beat_sheet.nbb.old.json` | Previous beat_sheet.nbb.json (body from slate) preserved before rebuild |

## SOURCE-DISCOVERY.md path and candidates

- Path: `nbb-vox-spindle-checkpoint/SOURCE-DISCOVERY.md`
- Candidates considered: 1 (the supplied MP4's own parent directory)
- Selection evidence: Supplied MP4 was found inside the candidate directory. `beat_sheet.json` carries `metadata.slug = "vox-spindle-checkpoint"`. All referenced `mp3/` and `clips/` assets exist. Unambiguous single-candidate match.

## Old-outro removal

| Old outro beats | Timecode removed |
|---|---|
| B14 (OutroSeries) — act: OUTRO | Body trim at 169.913 s removes both B14 and B15 |

## New verdict (NBB01) — unchanged from prior build

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Beat ID | NBB01 |
| Scene | ClaudeVerdictArtifact |
| Voice | Kokoro `am_onyx` (Bear substitute — ElevenLabs key invalid, see note below) |
| Narration | "Here's what the body just demonstrated. The spindle assembly checkpoint is not a readiness vote — it is a veto machine. One unattached kinetochore out of 92 can block the entire cell from dividing. The mechanism: that rogue kinetochore assembles MCC, which inhibits APC/C, which leaves securin intact, which keeps separase inactive. The chain holds until the last attachment is made. The trade-off: speed for accuracy. A cell that shortcuts this check gains time but risks aneuploidy — wrong chromosome counts, a known cancer driver. The checkpoint optimizes for fidelity over throughput, and that choice costs real minutes at every division." |
| Audio path | `nbb-vox-spindle-checkpoint/mp3/beat-NBB01.mp3` |
| Audio duration | 35.63 s |

| Voice | Kokoro `am_onyx` (Bear substitute — see note below) |
| Prompt | "Explain what happens in [cancer type] when the spindle assembly checkpoint is weakened. What proteins are mutated, what chromosome errors result, and why does aneuploidy drive tumor progression in this case?" |
| Audio path | `nbb-vox-spindle-checkpoint/mp3/beat-NBB02.mp3` |
| Audio duration | 7.17 s |

## Final MP4

| Field | Value |

- 9-frame 3×3 contact sheet: cold open (NBB00 @4s), title card (B01 @12s), section card (B06 @60s), MCC cascade (B08 @90s), walkthrough (B12 @150s), endcard (B13 @165s), verdict (NBB01 @185s), your turn (NBB02 @217s), outro (NBB03 @224s)

## Assembly notes

**One final encode approach:** The body segment was extracted from the REVIEW cut (not the slate) via stream-copy at [00:00, 169.913s] (no re-encode of body video). The wrapper beats (NBB00, NBB01, NBB02, NBB03) were previously rendered and reused unchanged. The final MP4 was assembled using the ffmpeg concat demuxer (stream-copy) joining the 5 segments: norm_NBB00 + body + norm_NBB01 + norm_NBB02 + norm_NBB03. Non-monotonic DTS warnings at join points were auto-corrected by ffmpeg (standard behavior for stream-copy concat at codec-compatible segments). The body was never re-encoded.

## ElevenLabs API key note

The ElevenLabs API key (`ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` in `.env`) returned HTTP 401 Unauthorized during this build (`art keys` confirmed the key is invalid). Bear's verdict (NBB01) and handoff (NBB02) were generated with **Kokoro `am_onyx`** as a Bear substitute (same voice as the cold open NBB00 — all wrapper beats use `am_onyx` consistently).

**To upgrade to the proper Bear voice when the key is repaired:**
1. Update `beat_sheet.nbb.json` beats NBB01 and NBB02: change `"engine": "kokoro"` to `"engine": "elevenlabs"`, remove `"voice"`, add `"voice_env": "ELEVENLABS_VOICE_NIKBEARBROWN"`.
2. Run: `python3 runtime/scripts/generate_audio.py nbb-vox-spindle-checkpoint/ --only NBB01 NBB02`
3. Re-conform and re-assemble the final MP4.
