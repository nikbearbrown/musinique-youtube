## Shot notes

- **B00**: ClaudeComposerAsk cold open. IN-FOR-BEAR LAW: "This is Liam, in for Bear." in first breath.
  Greeting: "Merhaba, Liam".
- **B01, B03, B05, B07, B10, B12**: Inner ask micro-beats. Greeting cue: "The ask," (SPARK-LINE LAW —
  non-empty greeting, never lonely asterisk).
- **B02, B04**: Strictly qualitative — no numbers on axes. Only show direction (up/up/up for B02;
  block labels for B04).
- **B06**: Hard stat chip: "$45,000 in meaningful work > $65,000 in pointless work". Verified in ch.1.
- **B11**: MBTI chip verbatim: "essentially no predictive validity for job performance". Big Five:
  "predicts modestly".
- **B14**: CARD/SLATE — no UI chrome (ILLUSTRATE LAW). Cream page, centered serif text.
  IN-FOR-BEAR sign-off: "Liam, in for Bear."
- **B15**: VERDICT — ClaudeVerdictArtifact. Narration: "Let's recap with Claude."
- **B16**: YOUR TURN — "Your turn." greeting. Prompt read ALOUD verbatim (HANDOFF LAW).
- **B17**: ClaudeTitleOutro — title "Claude, Observed", handle "@NikBearBrown".
