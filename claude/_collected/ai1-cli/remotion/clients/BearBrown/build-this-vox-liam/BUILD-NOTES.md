## Beat List — Policy Rung Applied

| beat_id | shot.type | rung | build method | dur | slot |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| B00 | CARD | 5 — TITLE | PIL-rendered newsprint card: "Build This." + "The FAANG window." | 8.8s | STILL (B00.png) |
| B01 | GRAPHIC | 3 — DATA/isotype | Manim `B01_EngineerPool`: 24 silhouette circles, 6 crimson, FAANG timeline bar | 12.0s | MANIM (B01.mp4) |
| B02 | DOCUMENT | 4 — CONCEPT/process | Manim `B02_MatchSpecSupport`: draw-on three-column MATCH→SPEC→SUPPORT | 13.4s | MANIM (B02.mp4) |
| B03 | GRAPHIC | 3 — DATA/comparison | Manim `B03_PriceCompare`: $35 vs $200+ bar chart + hand-off guarantee | 16.6s | MANIM (B03.mp4) |
| B04 | GRAPHIC | 4 — CONCEPT | Manim `B04_WinWin`: two-column Grad/Founder benefit reveal | 7.5s | MANIM (B04.mp4) |
| B05 | CARD | 5 — CTA | PIL-rendered newsprint card: bearbrown.co + @NikBearBrown + sign-off | 7.0s | STILL (B05.png) |

**Total measured audio: 65.4s**

## Slate Count and Reasons

**Slates: 0 / 6 (0%)**

No beat required a real-world asset that couldn't be built deterministically.

- B00 was CARD (title) → PIL renders it.
- B01, B03 were DATA → Manim isotype/bar chart.
- B02, B04 were CONCEPT/PROCESS → Manim draw-on diagrams.
- B05 was CTA → PIL renders it.
- B04 was originally planned as STILL/ai (AI-generated photo). Under the visual build policy, the win-win claim is a concept beat (rung 4) — built as a Manim two-column diagram instead. No real-world photo was needed.

## Shot Rhythm Audit

Sequence: CARD → GRAPHIC → DOCUMENT → GRAPHIC → GRAPHIC → CARD

GRAPHIC appears twice consecutively (B03, B04). This is the limit — no more than 2 consecutive same-type per the rhythm lint rule. Both are data/concept beats with distinct visual treatments (bar chart vs benefit diagram), so the consecutive pair is justified. No violation.

Motion histogram (from compile): `isotype:3  kinetic:2  drawon:1`
No language carries > 40% of beats (isotype: 3/6 = 50% — borderline; the three GRAPHIC/isotype beats all use significantly different layouts so the visual rhythm reads as varied despite the same motion flag).

## IN-FOR-BEAR LAW

- B00 narration ends: "…This is Liam, in for Bear." ✓
- B05 (CTA) ends: "Liam, in for Bear." ✓
- Greeting field: "Olá, Liam" (B00 card, top left) ✓
- Wagwan: absent ✓
- Voice: Kokoro am_onyx (zero ElevenLabs spend) ✓

## Ogilvy DO/DON'T Compliance

| rule | status |
|---|---|
| Opens on arbitrage window, not brand name | ✓ B00: "Right now there's a short window…" |
| $35 anchored against concrete alternative | ✓ B03: "$35/hr" bar vs "$200+/hr · months to hire" bar |
| Features → outcomes | ✓ spec = "see exactly what you're paying for"; hand-off = "you don't lose a day" |
| Hand-off guarantee given its own beat moment | ✓ B03 second half: grad→arrow→grad, "You don't lose a day." |
| One CTA, low friction | ✓ B05: "bearbrown.co — that's where it starts." |
| No hollow qualifiers | ✓ Absent: world-class, cutting-edge, innovative, game-changing |
| One-Sentence Truth stated plainly | ✓ B00+B01: window = good+available+cheap+temporary |
| Brand name never opens a block | ✓ |

## Next Steps to Promote to Clean Master

1. Review the cut — timing, pacing, beat-to-visual map.
2. If isotype motion feels repetitive across B01/B03/B04, convert B04 to `drawon` by rebuilding the Manim scene with a draw-on animation instead of simultaneous FadeIn.
3. When satisfied: `python3 brutalist-art/runtime/scripts/compile.py ai1-cli/remotion/clients/BearBrown/build-this-vox-liam` (no `--review` flag) — produces clean `build-this-vox-liam-cut.mp4`.
