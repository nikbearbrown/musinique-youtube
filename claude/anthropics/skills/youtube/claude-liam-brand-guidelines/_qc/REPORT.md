## Defects Fixed During Build

| Defect | Severity | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| BVDT props wrong (title/subtitle/verdict/lines) | BLOCKER | Read ClaudeVerdictArtifact schema; corrected to artifactTitle/artifactHeading/artifactLines in beat_sheet.json |
| B01 BrandGuidelinesAnatomy canvas fill | MAJOR | Rewrote scene: content start H*0.21, larger fonts, bigger cards, added bottom quote box |
| B02 BrandGuidelinesPipeline canvas fill | MAJOR | Rewrote scene: nodes centered at H*0.50, GAP = (W - 3*NODE_W)/4, percentage-based layout |
